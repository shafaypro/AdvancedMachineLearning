# AdvancedMachineLearning
This repo illustrates Advanced Machine learning algorithms and covers up all in python, tensorflow, spark and opencv.

## Week1
 
### Notebook:
    Linearmodels and optimizations

    This notebook includes linear models and its optimization functions.
    This includes:
    Logistic Regression from scratch.
    Cross-entropy minimization function for logistic
    Computing Gradient Descent Loss function
    Mini-Batch SGD (Random but faster than GD ) 
    SGD with Momentum (Accelerate SGD faster)
    RMSprop ( Improved RMS algorithm which uses squared Gradients to adjust learning rate )
